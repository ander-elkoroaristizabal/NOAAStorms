# Readme

In this repository I analyze the NOAA Storms dataset, 
in order to answer the following two questions: 

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The analysis is done in the NOAA_Storm_analysis.Rmd file, 
and can be read at the NOAA_Storm_analysis.md file. 

The dataset can be downloaded from the
[link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2). 
The explanatory documentation may be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf).
